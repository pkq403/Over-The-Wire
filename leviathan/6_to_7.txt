6 -> 7

Easy!, in home directory we find a binary "leviathan6" which asks us for a 4 digit number, we just debug it with gdb and we see a cmp instruction comparing it with 0x1bd3
we translate this to decimal and we get 7123
So we input that in the program and we obtain a shell as leviathan7 because it's an SUID binary and then we just have to 
cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan7
