3 -> 4

This is so much easier.
There's an executable "level3" at home dir. First we examine the symbols of the executable for example with
nm -n level3

and we see that there are call to shared libraries so we can use ltrace to see how does the program calls this functions

ltrace level3

Once we do this we see that there're 2 strcmp, the first one is just an author comment I guess, and the second one is the important in which we see that is comparing to "snlprintf\n" So we introduce that and we got the shell!

Then we just
cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan4
