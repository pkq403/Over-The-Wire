31 -> 32
This time is the same you do

git clone ssh://bandit29-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit29-git/repo

But now you have just to create key.txt file with the instructions written in the README.md
commit it and push it to the remote. Then you will obtain the password.

Note:
the only important thing is to delete the "*.txt" entry in the .gitignore so you can push it to the remote repo
