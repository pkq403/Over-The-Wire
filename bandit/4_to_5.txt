4 -> 5:
We have to inspect all files in inhere/ to see which one has human readable content
The instructions recommend to use "reset" command if the terminal gets messed up

What I did is run
head -n 1 ./-*
So I see the first line of all files and see which one is human readable
probably it would have been easier using the "file" command
