12 -> 13:

Here we have an data.txt that is a file compressed several times so we will have to check each time what type of compression does the file have, and then use the proper compressor to decompresse it.
We check which type of file it is with

file

This commands are used to decompress the file 

For gzip compressed files, we decompressed'em with:
gzip -d fichero.gz
gunzip fichero.gz

For bzip, we have used
bzip2 -d fichero.bz2

For tar
tar -xf fichero.tar

After lots of decompressions, we obtain an ASCII text file
which give use the password.
