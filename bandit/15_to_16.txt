15 -> 16:

The instructions tell us to submit the password of the previous exercise using SSL/TLS encription (the one that is used in HTTPS) to localhost:30001.

First, we check what service is running in that port with nmap

nmap -p 30001 localhost

And we get this service "pago-services1". It does not give us any info
So we tried directly to connect to localhost:30001 through SSL/TLS we do that with openssl s_client

openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001

We obtain some info about the certificate (CA) used for the connections, then we paste the password of the previous exercise, we press enter and we get the password.
