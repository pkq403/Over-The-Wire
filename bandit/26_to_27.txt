26 -> 27

The hard part here is to get a bandit26's shell.
We have to enter in vim mode like in the last exercise and once we have that we have to achieve a shell within vim this should be easy because you can do

:shell

But the problem is that the vim option shell has taken the $SHELL environment variable value which is /usr/bin/showtext so it does not give us anything. (to see that value we cando:)

:set shell

To see all this VIM variables/options we can do

:set all


This options are important because they influence in some VIM commands. Once we have set "shell" to /bin/bash with

:set shell /bin/bash

we can do


:shell

and obtain a bash. In bandit26's home directory there is a binary called bandit27_do which allows us to execute a command being bandit27 so we do

./bandit27_do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27

And that's how we obtain bandit27 password
