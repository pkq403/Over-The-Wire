21 -> 22:

We look at /etc/cron.d and find a file called "cronjob_bandit22" when we dump its content we find this

@reboot bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null

This means it's executing this script (every minute) "/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh" so we cat that script and we obtain:

#!/bin/bash
chmod 644 /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22


This means that is printing the bandit22 pw in that file so we cat that file and we obtain the password.
