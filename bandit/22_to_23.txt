22 -> 23

We do as in the previous one, read the cronjob and read the script that the cronjob is executing.

this is the script:
```
#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)
mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)

echo "Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/$myname to /tmp/$mytarget"

cat /etc/bandit_pass/$myname > /tmp/$mytarget
```

As we see is just hashing with md5sum the string "I am user bandit23"
so we do

 echo I am user bandit23 | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1

And here we obtain the hash to read the file

cat /tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349

And obtain the password.
