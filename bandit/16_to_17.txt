16 -> 17:

So first of all we run scripts of service and version recognizion with nmap on those
ports, and we obtain

PORT      STATE  SERVICE VERSION
31046/tcp open   echo
31518/tcp  open   ssl/echo
31691/tcp open   echo
31790/tcp open   ssl/unknown
31960/tcp open   echo

Here I notice that the only one that has no echo is 31790 so we tried to connect to it through ssl/tls with command:

openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790

The connection success but when I tried to send the password I get "KEYUPDATE" so I read the manual of openssl s_client in the "CONNECTED COMMANDS" section.

In the commnads section one of the commands is "K" 
and the password of the previous exercise.

As you see it starts with "K" so interprets it as a "K" to make it ignore that we have to call it with the "-quiet" parameter as it says in the manual like this

openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790

that returns an RSA private key to connect to the next exercise
