5 -> 6:
I have to find a file inside dir inhere/ that has the next conditions:
	* human-readable
	* size: 1033B
	* not - executable
We use this command to find a file non executable with size 1033B
"find . -type f ! -executable -size 1033c | file"

Then we assert that is an ASCII file with file command
