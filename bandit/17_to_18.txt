17 -> 18:

First we copy the RSA private key obtained in the previous exercise in a file inside ~/.ssh
and give it permissions over the owner because if it has permissions in groups or others it will not stablish the connection.

NOTE: if you have solved this level and see ‘Byebye!’ when trying to log into bandit18, this is related to the next level, bandit19"

We just do :

diff passwords.old passwords.new

and take the password.
