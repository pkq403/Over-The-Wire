29 -> 30
*remember you should use the "mktemp -d" so you could clone the repo in a persistent way inside the otw machine*

Here is the same (cloning a repo) but we have to move to the dev branch to extract the credentials as simple as that, so we do.

git clone ssh://bandit29-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit29-git/repo

Then we check what branches are created in the repo with

git branch -a

Then we create the dev branch linked with the remote "dev" branch so we do

git checkout -b dev origin/dev

Then we just cat the README file, so we obtain the password.
