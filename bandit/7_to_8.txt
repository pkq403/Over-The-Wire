7 -> 8
The password is stored in a huge file data.txt and the instructions says that the password is next to the word "millionth".

So we use this command
cat data.txt | grep millionth

This outputs:
millionth       <password> 
But we just want the second word, so we pipe with "cut" command
cat data.txt | grep millionth  | cut -f 2
