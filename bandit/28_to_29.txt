28 -> 29:
Here is the same (cloning a repo), but we have to go back 1 commit to see the leaked info
so we do
git clone ssh://bandit28-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit28-git/repo
Then we do 
git log
To see the commit history, we see that the last commit is commented as  "fix info leak" so we move to the previous one with:
git checkout 68314e012fbaa192abfc9b78ac369c82b75fab8f

And we obtain the password that was PATCH on the README file
