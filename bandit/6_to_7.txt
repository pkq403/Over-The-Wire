6 -> 7:
Have to find a file "somewhere on the server", so it can we anywhere with this
conditions:
	* owned by user bandit7
	* owned by group bandit6
	* 33 bytes in size
"find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2> /dev/null"

We use this find command with this filters and send stderr to /dev/null so I dont seee those files or directories that I do not have permissions to read (inspect),

The command outputs this path:
/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
